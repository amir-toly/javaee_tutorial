Rename CustomerController to CustomerCreateController, OrderController to OrderCreateController, CustomerForm to CustomerCreateForm and OrderForm to OrderCreateForm
Return a specific error when there is a DAOException while deleting customer/order
When there is an error on amount field, display back the wrong content instead of 0.0
Is it OK (disturbing message on page refresh) to display the same URL whether the form validation succeeds or not?
Use assertThat() instead of assertTrue() when possible
Use import static when possible
Limit Selenium dependency to testing scope
Remove all unnecessary public-declared constants
Rename order_date column to creation_date
Remove "ON DELETE SET NULL" option on fk_customer_id and handle MySQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException
Customer+Order insertion should be done in the same transaction
Session operations should be done only after database operations performed correctly
Use generics to factorize some code (i.e. in DatabaseToSessionFilter)
