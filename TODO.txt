Rename CustomerController to CustomerCreateController, OrderController to OrderCreateController, CustomerForm to CustomerCreateForm and OrderForm to OrderCreateForm
When there is an error on amount field, display back the wrong content instead of 0.0
Is it OK (disturbing message on page refresh) to display the same URL whether the form validation succeeds or not?
If there are no users in session, there is no reason to display the "New customer?" toggle
